Instructions on setting up mylar as a systemd service that will run on startup/via systemctl commands...

1 - copy the mylar.service to /lib/systemd/system/mylar.service
2 - create a symbolic link to it:  ln -s /lib/systemd/system/mylar.service /etc/systemd/system/mylar.service
3 - copy mylar.default to /etc/default/mylar (make sure it's renamed from mylar.default to just mylar)
4 - copy mylar.initd to /etc/init.d/mylar (rename it to just mylar) and then 'sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/mylar'
5 - edit the /etc/default/mylar file to your defaults (make sure to set MYLAR_USER & MYLAR_HOME as they're required)
6 - make systemd aware of new services: sudo systemctl daemon-reload
7 -                                     sudo systemctl enable mylar
8 -                                     sudo systemctl start mylar
9 - to check to see if running/status - sudo systemctl status mylar
